gap_cmd_dev_init(3)
==================


NAME
----
gap_cmd_dev_init - sends the init command


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int gap_cmd_dev_init (cc2540_t *'dev', gap_profile_t 'profile_role', uint8_t 'max_scan_responses', const uint8_t 'irk'[BT_IRK_LEN], const uint8_t 'csrk'[BT_CSRK_LEN], uint32_t 'sign_counter');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *gap_cmd_dev_init ()* function sends the init command to the _dev_ device
with a given _profile_role_, setting a maximum of _max_scan_responses_, a
16 byte Identity Resolving Key (IRK) and Connection Signature Resolving Key
(CSRK) and an initial signature counter.

If either _irk_ or _csrk_ are all 0's, the GAP will randomly generate them.

The list of available profile roles is as follows:

GAP_PROFILE_BROADCASTER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A device that sends public advertisings.

GAP_PROFILE_OBSERVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A device that listens to advertisings.

GAP_PROFILE_PERIPHERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A device that sends advertises so it can be connected from a central device. Advertising stops once it is connected.

GAP_PROFILE_CENTRAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A device that inits a connection.


RETURN VALUE
------------
*gap_cmd_dev_init ()* returns 0 for success, and an _errno_ like negative number for
failure (_errno_ is also set appropriately).
